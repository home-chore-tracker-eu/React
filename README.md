# React - MineChores

## Problem
-  Families are busy. Whether it’s fitting chores in-between your work hours, birthday parties or ballet lessons, if can be difficult to keep track of what needs done, who has done it, if their work is any good, and whether it should be rewarded.
- Kids and their phones, amiright??
## Solution
-  Children love games, and they love using their phone.  Why not take advantage of that? Our app makes chores slightly less sucky. There’s easy ways to create chores and assign them.  
- Keep track of what work is done by whom.  It’s easy to see who’s working hard, and who’s hardly working.
-  Want that shiny new gadget??  You can earn extra points by doing extra tasks.  Parents, that goes for you too :D
- Why gamble with Post-Its that can be lost, when you can have a permanent record of who is the Champion of the Household?
## Our Customer
- Parents aged 25 – 45 with children under 18 years old.
- Children  from aged 6 years + who love using their phone and love earning extra rewards.
