# React - MineChores

## Problem
-  Families are busy. Fitting chores in-between your work hours, birthday parties or ballet lessons can be . It can be difficult to keep track of what needs to be done and ensure chores are shared evenly. Post-It notes are used by many but these are easily lost and cannot be easily shared out in a way that’s trackable.
## Solution
-  Our app keeps track of chores and ensures they are divided evenly and fairly. Children love games, and they love using their phone, which helps them buy-in to the idea of being assigned chores. Children love being given responsibilities, they see it as a sign of growing up. Why not take advantage of that? With our app it’s easy to see who’s contributing and they can be rewarded effectively.

Assign a chore to a family member, set a deadline and you’re done.  

- Why gamble with Post-Its that can be lost, when you can have a permanent record of who is the Champion of the Household?
## Our Customer
- Parents with young children, aged between 7 and 14.rewards.
